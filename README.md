# Python Mastery: Challenges 🐍
This repository serves as a log of my journey toward becoming an advanced Python programmer and achieving true fluency in the language. My goal is to stop writing code with "accents" from other languages and fully embrace what the community defines as Pythonic code.

## 🚀 Methodology: The Refactoring Process
Every challenge consists of two distinct phases, reflecting my technical evolution:
1. Initial Version (Naive): My first attempt, prioritizing core functionality based on my current knowledge. This stage helps identify specific needs that Python can solve more elegantly.
2. Optimized Version (Fluent/Effective): A deep refactoring performed after studying the fundamentals in "Effective Python" and "Fluent Python". At this stage, I apply the Python Data Model to ensure my objects integrate naturally with the language's core features.

## 📚 Study Pillars
My solutions are guided by the principles extracted from the books:
• Pythonic Thinking: Strict adherence to PEP 8, prioritizing comprehensions over map/filter, and leveraging sequence unpacking.
• Data Model Mastery: Implementing special methods (dunder methods) to utilize protocols for sequences, iteration, and context management.
• Robustness & Typing: Implementing Type Hints for static error detection and following "Fail-Fast" principles through runtime validation.
• Efficiency: Utilizing advanced collections (e.g., deque, Counter, OrderedDict) and the standard library to avoid reinventing the wheel.

## 🛠 Tools & Standards
• Linter/Formatter: Using flake8 and blue to maintain consistency and PEP 8 compliance.
• Static Analysis: Mypy to verify data type integrity and catch bugs before runtime.
• Documentation: Every function and class includes detailed Docstrings explaining the "what" and "why" behind the logic.
